"""Rhys Sheehan CP1404 Prac 03 password_check"""

"""On paper, write a program that asks the user for a password, with error-checking to repeat if the password doesn't 
meet a minimum length set by a variable.
The program should then print asterisks as long as the word.
Example: if the user enters "Pythonista" (10 characters), the program should print "**********"."""
