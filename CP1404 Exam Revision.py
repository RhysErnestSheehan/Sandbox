"""CP1404 Exam Revision 2021"""


# 2. Ask the user for their age, then print the square of each number from that age down to zero
# age = input("What is your age: ")

# 3. Write a function that takes two integer input parameters, adds up the numbers between these (inclusive) and returns
# the total. If the first number is not less than the second number it should return 0.
# TODO
# number_1 = input("Number: ")
# number_2 = input("Number: ")

# 6. Write a function to count the number of words in a string (ignoring punctuation), e.g.
# s = "This is a sentence with words in it" print(count_words(s)) # displays 8

def count_number_of_words():
    string = input("Enter a string: ")
    for words in string:
        print()


count_number_of_words()

# 7. Write a function that takes in one integer parameter, n, and returns a list of n unique random numbers between
# 1 and 10 * n
# import random
#
#
# def list_random_numbers():
#     n = input("Number: ")
#     print(random.randint(1, 10, n))
#
#
# list_random_numbers()

# 8. Write a program that asks the user for a string then displays every letter in the string twice. E.g. if they input
# "hello exam" it should display "hheelllloo  eexxaamm"

# string = input("Enter a string: ")
# for char in string:
#     print(char * 2)

# 9. Explain how a programmer would choose whether to use a while loop or a for loop and give examples of each.
# A programmer would choose a while loop if they wanted something to happen while something else happened for example
# while an input in black print invalid input
# They would choose a for loop if they wanted something to happen for something in something else, for example for
# place in places

# 10. Describe the following terms: scope, exception, version control, commit, push, pull, merge, pull request,
# virtual machine, bytecode, interpreter, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, instance, object,
# class, method, attribute, class hierarchy, recursion,

# 2. Exceptions are a form of error that you can build into your code.
# 3. Version Control is taking snapshots of your code as you make changes so your can refer to them later or roll back
# your code to a previous version if something goes wrong.
# 4. A commit is adding something to version control.
# 5. A push is when you sync your version control to a remote source from your computer.
# 6. A pull is when your sync version control to your computer from a remote source
# 7. A merge is when you merge two version control repositories into one.
# 8. A pull request is when someone requests you
# 9. virtual machine is a virtualised version of an operating system.
# 10. bytecode is a form instruction set designed to be executed by a software interpreter.
# 11. interpreter is a computer program that executes code
# 12. abstraction
# 13. encapsulation is when you hide the details of a program to make it clearer and easier to change later
# 14. polymorphism means one message is sent to any object and it responds based on what type of object it is
# 15. Inheritance is when a class inherits something from another class
# 16. A Instance is a new version of a class object
# 17. AN object is a new instance of the class
# 18. A class is a file with code in it that can be reused in other files
# 19. Methods are similar to functions except they are tied to an object
# 20. Attributes are the different properties that an object has.
# 21. class hierarchy
# 22. recursion is when something calls itself. Like a function calling it self.
